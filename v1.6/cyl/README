Purpose:
   Galaxy Radiative Transfer in cylindrical grid system (r, phi, z)
   Two Dust Layers + Two Stellar Components
   Unit of the output image = (input luminosity unit) cm^-2 sr^-1

Version: 1.6.4
         (2016-03-22)

History:
   see HISTORY file

     The slowness was found that this is mainly because the inline optimization was not perfomed.
     INLINE directive should be explicitly included in raytrace.f90 so that the performance increased significantly.
   2015-12-02
     ifort is slower when raytrace routines are contained in a single module than when they are seperate routines as in old fortran.
     I tested this in my macbook pro, spicy, fims. But, gfortran is slightly faster when module is used.
     This is also true regardless of openmp, MPI.

Prerequisite:
      1. CFITSIO library should be installed. (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/)
      2. FFTW library should be installed. (http://www.fftw.org/)
      3. idl astronomy library, imdisp, and coyote IDL libraries are optionally required.

Howto run:
   1. Edit model.in
      no_photons        : number of photons
      hgg               : asymmetry factor for the Henyey-Greenstein function
      albedo            : dust albedo
      luminosity        : luminosity (whatever unit you want to use)
      out_file          : fits file name for the output image
      psf_file          : (optional) instrument PSF file for the output image
      rmax, zmax        : grid system size (0 < r < rmax, -zmax < z < zmax, etc)
      nr, np, nz        : number of cells in r, phi, z coordinates
      nprint            : how often do you wan to print
      inclination_anlge : rotation angle about x-axis (see docs/MoCafe_memo.pdf)
      position_anlge    : rotation angle about z-axis (see docs/MoCafe_memo.pdf)
      phase_anlge       : rotation angle about z-axis (see docs/MoCafe_memo.pdf)
      distance          : distance to the target galaxy
      nxim, nyim        : number of pixels of the output image
      output_mode = 1   : only total light is saved in outfile. (default)
      output_mode = 2   : scattered light and directed light are separately saved in outfile.
      left_right_fold = .true. (default)

   2. source type in "model.in"
      source%diskname = 'exponential'
      source%rscale   = 4.4
      source%zscale   = 0.500
      source%rmax     = 18.0
      source%zmax     = 7.0
      source%bulgename   = 'sersic'
      soure%sersic_index = 2.5
      source%Reff        = 2.0
      source%axial_ratio = 0.5
      source%BulgeToDisk = 0.33
      If there is no line starting with 'sersic', then only an exponential distribution will be assumed.

   3. make

   4. how to run
      mpi    : "mpirun -np 8 galaxy_mpi.x model.in"
      openmp : "galaxy.x model.in"
      serial : "galaxy_serial.x model.in"

   5. To plot the output, run "idl" and then excute plot_out ("r. plot_out")

   6. how to run in IDL environment
      cd idl_call
      make
      run the command "a = galaxy(/plot)" in IDL
