History:
  1.6.4  - 2016/03/22
           Now, grid spacing is automatically determined.
              (unless r_alpha and z_alpha are explicitly defined in model.in)
           xshift and yshift are added as parameters. output images will be shifted by (xshift, yshift).
              (default values are 0, 0)
           if left_right_fold = .true. (default), symmetric image will be obtained regardless with position_angle.
  1.6.3  - 2016/01/31, 2016/02/02
           Bug-fix in convolution_2D
           Bug-fix in sersic.f90
  1.6.2  - 2016/01/16
           Calling method of random number generators are changed.
           random_ and rand_ indicate subroutine and function, respectively.
  1.6.1  - 2016/01/09
           Include output_mode option is added.
           Coordination System definition is changed.
           inclination_angle, position_angle, and phase_angle are introduced instead of obs_angles(1:3).
  1.6    - 2015/12/16
           radial and vertical grids spacing is distributed in power-law (delta (z^pow_idx) = constant.)
           raytrace.f90 is modified to use arbitrariy grid spacing.
  1.5d   - 2015/12/11
           bug-fixed in random.f90 and sersic.f90 (saved varaibles should be declared in THREADPRIVATE directive)
  1.5c   - 2015/12/07
           a bug-fixed in random_rexp. $OMP CRITICAL section is inserted for saved variables in random.f90
           left_right_fold parameter is introduced to increase SNR
  1.5b   - 2015/12/03
           The program now accpet commandline argument. (usage: galaxy_cyl.x model.in)
           (Don't do "galaxy_cyl.x < model.in")
           minor bug fixed in setup.f90 and in setting iseed.
           mpi version is also included.
           raytrace routines are now in a module single file and explicit INLINE compiler directives have been added.
           add_direc and peelingoff are now in a single module file.
           readfits and write_out are in a single module file.
  1.5a   - 2015/11/29
           image convolution is performed for each thread (not for final image).
           the convolved images are used to obtain not only intensities but only uncertainties.
           The previous method gave negative values in sqrt, sometime.
  1.5    - 2015/11/28
           overall structure is changed.
           convolution of sigma^2 and PSF^2 is set to 0.0 when it gives negative value.
  1.4a   - 2015/11/21
           can convolve output images (scatt, direc, scatt_sig, direc_sig) with an instrumental PSF.
           bug-fixed in sersic.f90. SAVE attributed vaiables are implicitly assumed to be SHARED in openMP.
  1.4    - 2015/11/19
           included the Sersic Bulge component.
           bug-fixed in galaxy_cyl_idl.f90 and setup[_idl].f90 routines. (memory leaked in idl interfaced routines)
  1.3    - 2015/10/21
           calculate uncertainties maps.
           (0st HDU - scattered light, 1st HDU - direct light)
            (2nd HDU - uncertainty of scattered light, 3rd HDU - uncertainty of direct light)
           forced first scattering - main_omp.f90 (openmp) or main_serial.f90
           pathlength strentching (biasing) algorithm - main_v2, main_v3, main_v4.f90
  1.2    - 2013/07/11
           bug fixed in luminosity scaling in add_direc.f90 and peelingoff.f90
  1.1    - 2013/07/04
           minor bug fix in setup.f90
  1.0    - 2013/06/27
           bug fixed in tmatrix
