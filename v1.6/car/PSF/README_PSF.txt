1. original GALEX PSFs (PSFfuv.fits.gz and PSFnuv_faint.fits.gz) are from
	http://www.galex.caltech.edu/researcher/techdoc-ch5.html

   PSF_GALEX_FUV.fits.gz and PSF_GALEX_NUV.fits.gz are obtained by fitting the radial profile with Moffat + Aureole function.
   These files have been extended to larger angular scales.

2. TNG V-band PSF is derived from a star observed by TNG DOLORES in the field of NGC 891 (Kwangil Seon, 2015-11-29).
